## Installation for Laravel 7.x

Using the `composer require` command:

```
composer require larashed/agent
```

## Installation for Laravel 6.x

Using the `composer require` command:

```
composer require larashed/agent:6.*
```

## Installation for Laravel 5.x

Using the `composer require` command:

```
composer require larashed/agent:5.x.*
```

For Laravel 5.4 and below, add service provider

```
Larashed\Agent\AgentServiceProvider::class
```

## Usage and configuration

Edit your `.env` file and add the following:
```bash
LARASHED_APP_ID=<Your App ID>
LARASHED_APP_KEY=<Your App key>
```

If you'd like to disable monitoring for certain environments use:
```bash
LARASHED_IGNORED_ENVS=env1,env2
```

By default requests are tracked with your application's user's Id and name. If you'd like to disable it, use:
```
LARASHED_COLLECT_USER_DATA=false
```

----
In some cases you may need to configure the agent to use a socket path not relative to the project's storage directory.
If you're running Linux on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you cannot make use of unix domain sockets located in `/mnt`.

To change the directory of the domain socket use:
```
LARASHED_SOCKET_DIR=/absolute/dir/to/socket
```

### Running the agent

```
php artisan larashed:agent
```

We recommend using [Supervisord](http://supervisord.org/installing.html) to keep the agent daemon alive,
but you can use any software you prefer to keep it running.

```
[program:larashed-agent]
command=php /home/forge/app.com/artisan larashed:agent
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stdout_logfile=/home/forge/app.com/larashed-agent.log
```

### Tracking deployments

```
php artisan larashed:deploy
```

### Publishing config file

The default agent config should suffice for most users, however if you need to change it, you'll have to publish it first.
To publish `larashed.php` configuration file, run:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=larashed
```

### Golang agent

The `larashed/agent` PHP composer package hooks into your application and collects the necessary metrics (HTTP requests, queue jobs, database queries, etc.), that data is then sent over IPC using a UNIX domain socket.
 
When you run `php artisan larashed:agent`, it downloads our [Golang agent](https://github.com/larashed/agent-go) which is responsible for a number of things:
- Starts the socket server
- Collects and sends server metrics
- Sends application metrics received from this package
